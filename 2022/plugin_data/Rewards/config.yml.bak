# Reward streaks are strikes when you claim your reward multiple times in a row
# Strikes start at 1 when you claim your reward 2 times in the timespan of waiting_time * 3
# E.g. when you have to wait 1 day, you can wait up to 48 hours after you claimed your reward to claim it again to start a streak
reward_streaks: true # false to disable this feature

# The time how long the players have to wait before claiming their rewards again
# The time is in seconds
